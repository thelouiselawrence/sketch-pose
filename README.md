# Sketch & Pose
App for posing creating character pose references for artists

The online version is available at
https://thelouiselawrence.github.io/sketch-pose/index.html

In addition to being a useful tool (when it is finished), this app is an exercise in pushing the limits of JavaScript and the pages functionality of GitHub pages (which by the way is cool when it works). It also will have procedural generated content.

## Roadmap
- Create a default scene with objects
- Generate rigged character models of humans, with some variety
- Add basic props (primitives, common furniture) and lights
- Basic editing functionality (move, scale, rotate, duplicate, delete)
- Save and upload models (eventually)
- AR support (view models in the real world)
